# Test sets

What each function of the package was tested on, and what each test set is. The reference behind a test decides
what the test can show: a probability sample of the map supports an estimate for the map; a benchmark split or a
hand-picked set supports a comparison between methods on that set, not a statement about a map. The per-experiment
record is [Comparisons](results/comparisons.md); every number cited there is a claim in the
[ledger](method/claims.md).

## By function

## The test sets

"Probability sample" asks whether the labelled units are a random sample of the map with known inclusion
probabilities, the condition for an estimate of the map's accuracy. Licences are as stated by each publisher;
"Host" is where the record read the data.

## What the test sets do not cover

- Few probability samples of maps: LCMAP's (2018), NLCD's two assessment samples (2001 to 2016), GFC2020's (forest,
  2020) and East Africa's (random within seven countries, 2015 to 2017). The points stand in for the maps, so these
  grade the procedures exactly on the points; products are compared through crosswalks, and several pairs are related
  (NLCD and LCMAP, GFC2020 and WorldCover).
- Most of the evidence is linear probes on frozen embeddings, graded against benchmark splits that are not samples
  of any map. The hand-labelled image testbeds are mostly binary water.
- The fine-tuned evidence is two Ai2 models graded on their own validation sets.

## Why the data are not re-hosted

The checks rerun from the per-unit values committed in `exp/out/` (for example `exp92_plots.csv`, `exp78_units/`),
which hold no coordinates. The raw data stay with their publishers, at the revisions pinned in
`exp/out/upstream_revisions.json`, and their licences differ: WorldFloods v2 is non-commercial, DFC2020 is released
to approved contest participants, and Sen1Floods11's labels carry no stated licence. The DFC2020 reference classes
once committed in `exp/out/exp66_masks.npz` were removed on 5 October 2026; exp66's results stand as an internal record. exp94's per-point files hold values derived from the publishers' data under the licences in the table above; the ODSE-LULC columns of `exp/out/exp94_europe_points.csv` (`odse_corine`, `odse`, `odse_prob`) derive from a CC BY-SA 4.0 product and are shared under CC BY-SA 4.0. A copy on Hugging Face would add
nothing the record needs and could breach those terms.
