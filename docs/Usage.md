# Usage

The package [`oe_inferencex/`](../oe_inferencex/) is torch-free. It takes a
prediction map and returns a review plan with a reason per flagged window;
with a reference map it also scores the plan.

## Modules

| Module | What it gives you |
|---|---|
| `assess` | Review sets at any budget from a logit, probability or exported-confidence map, in confidence order or in the boundary-first order; error rate, capture at each budget and tie-aware AURC when a reference map exists |
| `explain` | Why each flagged window is suspect: label-free cues, each with its measured share among error and correct windows and the experiment that measured it |
| `signals` | Confidence, the boundary indicator, tiling instability, the NDWI cues and the pixel controls, as pure functions |
| `metrics`, `stats` | Tie-aware AURC and capture at a budget, exact sign tests, one vote per cluster, block and cluster bootstraps |
| `taskcard`, `lcc` | What each fine-tuned OlmoEarth model is; a range reader for the served change rasters |

## Assess a prediction and explain the review set

```python
import numpy as np
from oe_inferencex.assess import assess_prediction, summary
from oe_inferencex.explain import explain_review_set
from oe_inferencex.signals import ndwi_level

logits = np.load("water_logits.npy")        # (H, W) binary logits, or (C, H, W) per class
s2 = np.load("s2_window.npy")               # (12, H, W) Sentinel-2 bands, for the spectral cue

out = assess_prediction(logits, is_logit=True, patch=4, budgets=(0.05, 0.10), order="boundary_first")
why = explain_review_set(out, cues={"ndwi_ambiguous": ndwi_level(s2, patch=4) > -0.1})

summary(out)["review_sets"]["0.05"]         # the 4-px windows to review first, with the boundary share of the set
why["budgets"][0.05]["windows"][0]          # {'row': 28, 'col': 26, 'confidence': 0.48, 'cues': ['boundary', 'low_confidence', 'ndwi_ambiguous']}
why["quotes"]["ndwi_ambiguous"]             # "is spectrally ambiguous ... (48% of error windows vs 7% of correct ones, 7.2x; ...)"
```

- `order="confidence"` (default) reviews the least confident windows first,
  the ranker every experiment scored. `order="boundary_first"` reviews the
  boundary windows first, then the interior, each by confidence; it
  captures more errors at 5 to 10% budgets on hand labels (exp36). AURC
  entries always score confidence.
- `explain_review_set` derives the boundary and low-confidence cues from
  the assessment itself. Any other cue is a boolean array of window shape
  the caller derives: spectral ambiguity from the input bands as above,
  tiling instability from a second forward pass on a 2-px shifted window
  (`signals.aligned_tile_phase`), a reference-side fact such as JRC
  seasonality. Cues in `explain.CUES` are quoted with their measured
  enrichment; other names are reported as unmeasured.
- Arrays stay in `out["arrays"]`. `summary(out)` is the JSON-safe view that
  crosses a tool boundary, as the [agent contract](method/agent_integration.md)
  requires: summary statistics cross, rasters are written to files.

## The production case: a class map with an exported confidence band

```python
from oe_inferencex.assess import assess_classmap

out = assess_classmap(hard_map, confidence_band, n_classes=9, patch=4, order="boundary_first")
out["warnings"]        # reports ties: a quantized or saturated band can only rank the pixels it separates
```

The served change rasters export no class confidence at all; there the
boundary fraction is the only cue (exp20), and `lcc` reads the rasters by
HTTP range request.

## With a reference map

Pass `reference=` (class labels, values below 0 for no reference) and the
assessment adds `against_reference`: the error rate, the errors captured at
each budget in the chosen review order, the tie-aware AURC of confidence
and of the boundary indicator, the oracle and random baselines, and the
caveat that reference-product labels flatter boundary-type signals (exp18).
Grade on expert labels; never train a rule on them.

## Scoring a new rule the same way

`metrics.capture_at_budget_expected` and `metrics.excess_aurc` score a
candidate per unit; `stats.sign_test`, `stats.clustered_sign_test` and
`stats.cluster_bootstrap_difference` test it across units; `explain.cue_enrichment`
validates an explanation cue. The experiment scripts in `exp/` show the
full pattern, two references at once with controls; the
[protocol](method/protocol.md) is the rulebook.

## Reproduce

```bash
uv sync                                 # the package only, no torch
uv run pytest                           # the package against the recorded numbers
uv sync --extra encoder --extra geo     # full experiment environment (Linux resolves the cu128 torch build)
uv run python scripts/audit_one_scene.py   # one scene end to end
```

Named entry points live in [`scripts/`](../scripts/); each wraps the numbered
experiment it runs, so the experiment file stays the record and the script is
the formal name (`scripts/audit_one_scene.py` runs `exp/exp02_full_slice.py`).
Experiments are `exp01`–`exp38` in [`exp/`](../exp/), outputs under
`exp/out/`, chronology in the [lab log](../exp/NOTES.md). Cluster jobs
follow the pattern in [infrastructure](method/infrastructure.md).
