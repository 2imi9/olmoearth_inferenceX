## 1. Ranking a model's own errors

The core question here is selective classification: order predictions so the
least trustworthy come first, and measure the trade-off between coverage and
risk. That plain confidence is hard to beat is the field's default finding,
not a surprise, and the results here should be read in that light.

Five requirements for a multi-threshold selective-classification metric, which AURC fails, and AUGRC, the average risk of undetected failures, which reorders methods on five of six datasets. This record reports excess AURC and capture at a budget; AUGRC is the statistic it should add before any ranking claim is called settled.

Decomposes the gap to a perfect ordering into Bayes noise, approximation, ranking, statistical and shift terms, and shows monotone post-hoc rescalings cannot move the ranking term. The theory behind what exp70 and exp73 found: every rescaling of confidence tried here was doomed a priori, and only feature-aware reorderings could have won.
- Heng et al. (2026). Know When to Abstain: Optimal Selective Classification with Likelihood Ratios. *ICLR*.
  [arXiv:2505.15008](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15008). The Neyman-Pearson view: the optimal selector is a likelihood ratio, of which the usual baselines are special cases, with gains reported under covariate shift. A likelihood-ratio selector is the one post-hoc family this record never scored against the margin; a candidate test, see section 7.

  [arXiv:2403.14715](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14715). Label smoothing degrades selective classification by suppressing the top logit more on correct predictions than on wrong ones; a logit normalisation restores the ordering. The mechanism behind the warning here that the readout head's training regime decides whether its margin ranks errors.

  [OpenReview d8WMoi571f](https://openreview.net/forum?id=d8WMoi571f). Calibration and misclassification detection are different, partly opposed objectives. The record uses the distinction throughout without citing it: the margin is scored as a ranker, and expected calibration error is reported apart.

  [OpenReview vXoAglgsmX](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vXoAglgsmX). Class margin dispersion: the whole margin distribution rather than top-1 minus top-2, reported to win on AURC. A workshop result, but the only published attack on this record's exact score on its exact metric; cheap to test on the 24 tasks, see section 7.

  [arXiv:2603.29941](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.29941). Pixel uncertainty must be aggregated before it can flag a region, and aggregators that use spatial structure beat the global average on failure detection across ten datasets.

## 3. Why signals from inside the encoder carry no error information

The retargeted-residual line asked whether the pretraining objective's own
error could locate task errors. It could not, and the representation-learning
literature says why: a reconstruction or masking objective tracks the data's
variance subspace, which need not align with what a task needs.

  foundations of representation learning using unlabeled data: statistics and

  reconstruction learns principal components, which need not be the
  task-relevant directions; every downstream bound assumes a linear probe on
  the frozen representation, which makes the probe's own regularisation a
  separate factor (the exp68 warning).

## 7. Published challenges to this record, and what it answers

Added 18 September 2026. The search above was run in part to find published
claims that contradict a recorded finding. Each row names the challenge, what
the record already says, and whether the question is answered, open or
untested. Nothing here changes a claim; the untested rows are the experiments
the record would need next, with their cost.

| Challenge | What it claims | What the record says | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Traub et al. 2024, AUGRC | AURC ranks methods wrongly on five of six datasets; AUGRC is the interpretable statistic | Every ranking claim here is excess AURC plus capture at a budget; AUGRC was never computed | Answered (exp76 and exp70's artifact): for fixed errors AUGRC orders readings as the failure AUROC does; the margin beats the best control on 23 of 24 by AUROC, and the best reading is the same under both statistics on 22 of 24 |
| Rabanser and Papernot 2025 | Only feature-aware, reordering scores can close the ranking gap | Every rejected signal was a monotone rescaling or a feature-space score that lost; the theory predicts the record | Answered, and now cited |
| Heng and Soh 2026, likelihood ratios | The optimal selector is a likelihood ratio, with gains under covariate shift | Never scored here; the Mahalanobis and typicality scores tested are not likelihood ratios of correct against wrong | Untested: a likelihood-ratio selector on the 24 tasks, one CPU job |
| Class margin dispersion, ECCV 2026 workshop | The whole margin distribution beats top-1 minus top-2 on AURC | The record's score is top-1 minus top-2 only | Tested in part (exp76): the published definition could not be retrieved; a margin-dispersion score defined here beat the better probability form on 0 of 24 tasks, and no whole-vector score on more than 3 |
| Guarino et al. 2026; Soft Dice Confidence 2026 | The aggregator from pixels to regions is a first-class choice; spatially aware aggregation wins | The 4-px window score is the margin of window-mean probabilities, chosen without a test | Tested (exp76): five aggregators on the seven segmentation tasks; the form matters, the aggregator does not, since the same form on window-mean probabilities beats its pixel-level aggregate on 6 of 7 |
| Kondylatos et al. 2025 | Pretrained representation uncertainty works zero-shot in Earth observation | exp17 tested band-set disagreement, depth probes, logit lens and attention entropy; not this reading | Untested: needs their pretrained uncertainty head, an encoder pass |
| Lehmann et al. 2026 | Confidence of frozen geospatial encoders miscalibrates under corruption and shift; ensembles do not help | exp74 scored ranking under 16 encoders on clean splits; ensembles lost in exp73 | Half answered: agrees on ensembles; shift was never applied here |
| Johnson et al. 2026, RSE | A spatially aware, calibrated uncertainty for this model class | Not scored | Untested, encoder-side |
| Consensus mapping 2026; CODA 2025 | Fusion of independent raters pays; consensus selects models | Dawid-Skene fusion and a second same-family model were rejected | Answered with a scope: the rejection is within one family; cross-family raters were never tried |
| Nguyen et al. 2025, concepts | Logit-level signals stay overconfident; concept rankings do better | No concept model exists for these encoders | Not applicable without one |
| nnActive 2025; Outshining the Random Baseline 2026 | Active learning beats random only against a naive random baseline, or only after fixing imbalance and redundancy | exp56 found suspicion-ordered selection worse than random at every budget | Half answered: exp56's random baseline was plain random; the imbalance fix was not applied |
| Xu et al. 2024, RSE; illusion of success 2024; PANGAEA 2025 | 10 m references carry geolocation and label error; curated test sets inflate accuracy; benchmarks are geographically biased | The five-reference design and the design-weighted estimators address the first; the suite's splits are the model authors', not a landscape sample | Answered in part; the spatial support of the 24 tasks is not characterised |
| Goel et al. 2025, CAPA | Raw disagreement between models is confounded by their accuracies | exp75 reports raw vote disagreement and KL | Untested and cheap: recompute exp75's readings as chance-adjusted agreement |
| Kao et al. 2026, UnivEARTH; DataMind 2026 | Most agent failure is execution failure in a sandbox, not reasoning | exp64's sandbox arm produced no gradeable answer in 51 of 120 runs at 7B | Answered: the record already separates unanswered from wrong |

Tests this suggests, in order of cost: AUGRC, a margin-dispersion score and five
window aggregators were run as exp76. Still not run: CAPA for exp75, a
likelihood-ratio selector on the 24 tasks, and representation uncertainty and
the Matérn estimator, which need encoder passes.

**Lazy aggregation** (Shi, Yu and Yang, *Vision Transformers Need More Than Registers*, arXiv 2602.22394, Apr 2026). The challenge: a ViT's global representation is assembled from background patches, so a token can be confidently labelled by its neighbourhood rather than by its content, which would be a mechanism for the confident errors this record cannot see. Their probe needs a CLS token and their fix changes pre-training; OlmoEarth has neither a CLS token nor register tokens in the released checkpoints, and its pre-training is Ai2's. **Tested on the surrogate available on frozen tokens** (a token against its own tile's mean), exp77: the signature is present on 5 of 7 segmentation tasks but is confounded with class frequency and needs labels to compute; as a ranker it loses to the margin on 7 of 7; and removing the scene direction costs accuracy on all seven. The mechanism is closed on the surrogate, not on their probe. <!-- claim:scene-typicality-loses-to-the-margin -->
