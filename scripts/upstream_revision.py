"""Which upstream revision the record was measured against, and whether upstream has moved since.

    python scripts/upstream_revision.py scan              # "repo_type repo_id sha" lines from a local HF cache
    python scripts/upstream_revision.py scan --cache DIR
    python scripts/upstream_revision.py check             # network: the pinned revisions against main today

Every experiment here calls `hf_hub_download` or `snapshot_download` with no `revision=`, so a run took whatever
`main` pointed at that day and no artifact recorded which bytes those were. `exp/out/upstream_revisions.json`
closes that: one commit sha per upstream repository the record rests on, read out of the Hugging Face caches the
runs actually used.

That file is a measurement of someone else's system at a point in time, not a statistic, so unlike
`headroom_by_encoder.json` it has no generator and cannot have one: it can only be re-measured. `scan` is how it
was measured and how to measure it again, and the record names the host and the command behind every reading.

`check` is the half that earns its keep later. It asks the Hub what `main` points at now and names every
repository that has moved, which is the question "is a fresh run comparable to the recorded one?" — the question
that had no answer at all until 21 September 2026. It also names any repository the code fetches that the record
does not pin, so a new upstream dependency cannot be added silently; `tests/test_upstream_revisions.py` asserts
the same thing offline.

Standard library plus huggingface_hub (a core dependency of the package) for `check` only; `scan` needs neither.
