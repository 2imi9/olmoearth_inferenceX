"""exp93 (the certified zone on LCMAP's own confidence) by a second route.

From the committed per-plot values (exp/out/exp92_plots.csv), with code written here and scipy's hypergeometric
distribution rather than the package's sums: the disclosed population facts; for every rule, grid and cell, the
exact probability that a zone wrong more than alpha of the time passes its own test (the first such level for the
prefix rule, the sum over such levels at delta / J for Bonferroni), which bounds the violation probability, must be
at most delta, and must hold the recorded Monte Carlo share within its noise; P4's 0.867 summed exactly; and the
package's public certify_zone, run on the experiment's own draws, certifying what the run recorded."""
