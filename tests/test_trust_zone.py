"""The trusted-zone certification (docs/plan/trust_zone.md, exp80), checked by enumeration rather than simulation.

The guarantee P(zone error rate > alpha) <= delta is a theorem for both rules on any map: Bonferroni over the
levels, and the prefix rule, which is fixed-sequence testing over levels ordered before any label is read. Neither
needs the zone error rate to rise as the zone grows. On a population of 20 windows and a budget of 8 every one of
the 125,970 possible draws can be enumerated, so the violation probability is computed exactly and compared with
delta; on maps of 10 and 12 windows every error pattern meets every draw; the hypergeometric sums are checked
against exact rational arithmetic; and the arithmetic limit on what a budget can certify is checked at both edges."""
