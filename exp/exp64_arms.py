"""exp64's four arms, their tools, and the grading. Imported by exp64_agent_benchmark.py.

Split out of the experiment file so the card builder stays readable. Everything here is numpy and the standard
library except the HTTP call to the served model, which is the only part that needs the cluster.

The answer contract. Grading free prose is not reproducible, so every arm emits ONE json object and the prompt says
so. A model that emits something else is not silently rescued: the parse failure is recorded per card and counted,
because "the agent could not produce a gradeable answer" is a result about the arm and not a bug in the harness.

  {"review_windows": [[r, c], ...],
   "explanations":   [{"window": [r, c], "cue": "<name>", "value": <number or null>}, ...],
   "comparison":     {"n_differing": <int>, "where": "<short phrase>", "believe": "decline"|"first"|"second"}}

The claims audit tolerance. exp72 measured the two implementations of these statistics against each other on real
probe output and found the review set bit-identical but the summary statistics apart by up to 2.7e-05, because the
probe emits float32 and a pure-Python tool works in double. So a number in an answer is matched against the tool
outputs with a tolerance, never by string equality: an exact-match audit would score a correct agent as unsupported
for reporting the same quantity at a different precision.
