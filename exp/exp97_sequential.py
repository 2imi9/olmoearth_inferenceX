"""exp97: a trusted zone that stays certified however often the reviewer looks (preregistered 8 October 2026).

    python exp/exp97_sequential.py run       # reads exp95's committed cells and exp/out/exp79_units (local)
    python exp/exp97_sequential.py smoke     # synthetic units

**Why.** certify's guarantee holds for one run at a budget fixed before any label (exp96's audit, e85d202): a
reviewer who labels, certifies, adds labels and certifies again gave a wrong zone on 21% to 30% of draws on six maps
where one run is wrong at most 12.25%. The user asked for the real fix (8 October 2026): a certificate that is valid
at every look.

**The rule tested ('sequential', oe_inferencex/sequential.py).** Each grid zone is tested by an e-process on the
labels inside it, read in the order they were drawn: the likelihood ratio of a zone with M wrong windows against one
with M0 = floor(alpha n) + 1, averaged with equal weights over M = 0 .. M0 - 1 (Robbins's method of mixtures), in
closed form through one hypergeometric tail. It is a supermartingale under every count M >= M0 (tests/test_sequential.py
checks it in exact arithmetic, and Ville's bound by dynamic programming over every path on small zones). A zone passes
once its e-process has reached 1/delta and stays passed. Zones are tested in a fixed sequence from an anchor, fixed
before any label, outward; the certified zone is the largest one that, with every zone between it and the anchor, has
passed. So the chance that any look ever certifies a zone wrong more than alpha is at most delta, and the certified
zone never shrinks as labels are added. The default anchor, fixed before this experiment on synthetic maps only (no
cell below was read for it): the smaller of 0.25 and the smallest grid coverage whose zone expects
`min_labels_sequential` labels at the sample's first budget n0 (sequential.anchor_coverage; `sample --design
sequential --alpha` records it in the sidecar). A zone with no wrong label needs `min_labels_sequential` labels, 71
at alpha 0.05 and delta 0.1, where certify's one-look test needs 45: the price of the equal weights, which keep a zone
certifiable after wrong labels, not of reading at every label (an e-process on M = 0 alone passes a clean zone at 45
and never after a wrong label). What exp97 measures as cost is the cost of this rule.

**Cells.** exp95's 34 cells (committed) and exp96's 332 held-out cells (exp/out/exp79_units, local; sha256 recorded),
366 maps, in exp80's zone order; alpha half the cell's error rate; delta 0.1; the package's grid. Budgets exp95's
ladder: round(50 x 1.05^i) from 50 to 3,000 and below half the cell's units. 400 nested draws per cell (a draw is one
random order of the units; the sample at budget n is its first n, as a reviewer who adds labels), from a seed per
cell, SeedSequence([97, crc32(cell name)]), so that cells of the same size do not share their draws.

**Arms.** F: certify as shipped (prefix rule, standard cut), rerun at every budget of the ladder on the same draws.
S(n0): sequential with the default anchor at first budget n0 = 300 and n0 = 1,000 (where n0 is below half the
units). S(c): sequential with the anchor fixed at coverage c = 0.1, 0.25, 0.5. Every arm reads the same draws and is
checked at every ladder budget; P1 grades every S arm, the rest of each S(c) arm is descriptive.

**Measured, per cell and arm.** The pathwise violation: the share of draws on which the zone certified at some
ladder budget is wrong more than alpha; for S also the full claim, the share on which any zone of the certified
sequence at the last budget is wrong more than alpha (it contains the pathwise event, since the certified zone never
shrinks). C(n), the mean certified coverage (0 when no zone); the area, the mean of C over the ladder. The label ratio
rho: with target half of F's largest C, the first ladder budget at which S's C reaches the target over the first at
which F's does, nf (infinite if S's never does within the ladder). The implementation check: on the first two draws of
every cell, each level's pass time against `sequential.level_path`, and each arm's zone at six budgets spread over the
ladder against the package's `certify_zone` (F, standard cut) and `certify_zone_sequential` (S).

**Predictions** (SE = sqrt(0.09 / 400) = 0.015).
- P1 (validity): every S arm's full-claim violation, and so its pathwise violation, is at most 0.1 + 5 SE = 0.175 on
  every cell (the guarantee; about 3,100 rates are read, 1,560 of them distinct full-claim rates; the exact binomial
  tail at 0.1 makes the chance of any rate above 0.175 about 0.005 if all hold at delta). Rates above 0.1 + 3 SE are
  counted, as exp96 did.
- P2 (the harness is the package): the implementation check finds no mismatch on any cell. It can fail; the
  certified zone not shrinking with labels holds by construction in the harness and is recorded, not predicted.
- P3 (replication of exp96's audit, not a new prediction): on the six maps exp96's audit followed, F's pathwise
  violation exceeds 0.175. The share of the 366 cells where it does is reported.
- P4 (cost): on the cells where n0 = 300 is checked, F's largest C is at least 0.1 and the ladder reaches 2 nf (so that
  rho <= 2 can be decided), S(300)'s median rho (np.median of finite and infinite values) is at most 2.

**Decision, fixed now.** If P1 and P2 hold, sequential certify ships as an option (`sample --design sequential`, read
from the top; certify then uses this rule); certify's default stays the one-look rule, and the record states P4's
value as the cost of this rule whether P4 holds or not. If P1 or P2 fails, it does not ship and the failure is
investigated. P1 restates a theorem checked in exact arithmetic, so the decision is expected to be to ship; P4 and the
areas are the informative results.

**Disclosure, before this commit.** To time the harness, run_cell was run at seed 97 (one seed for every cell, the
version before per-cell seeds) on two of the 366 cells, MADOS and Sen1Floods11 (exp95's), and every arm's area and
pathwise violation on them were printed. Nothing above was changed because of them; the two cells stay in the grading
(with their own seeds now, so with other draws). The independent review of this preregistration (three lenses) read
only F curves already recorded by exp95 and exp96.

**What it does not show.** Power on maps other than these; budgets above 3,000; alpha other than half the error rate;
a reviewer whose labels are wrong; anchors other than those listed; other weights for the mixture. The held-out maps
share the 24 tasks' labels. The anchor cannot move to smaller zones as labels accrue without splitting delta (a
weighted fallback could hold part of delta for a smaller zone); that is not tested.
