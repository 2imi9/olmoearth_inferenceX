"""exp70: the ranking protocol across the whole of Ai2's published task suite, on tasks this project did not choose.

Why. The strongest objection to everything in this repository is that we picked our own testbeds. Sen1Floods11, the AWF
points, GEOID-Flood and the four references of exp66 to exp69 were each chosen here, one at a time, for a reason we
also wrote. A reader is entitled to ask whether the margin ranks errors on tasks nobody selected to make it look good.

Ai2's `olmoearth-paper-embeddings` answers that objection cheaply and completely. It is the embedding set behind their
own paper: 25 tasks for OlmoEarth Base, chosen by them for their evaluation and not by us, with the splits fixed in the
files. Seven carry the `m_` prefix because they are GEO-Bench tasks, a third-party benchmark from ServiceNow Research
with its own paper and published baselines. Because the embeddings are published there is no encoder pass at all: the
whole suite is 68 GB of tensors and the protocol runs on top of them.

What this is not. GEO-Bench and Ai2's suite both measure ACCURACY, and no public benchmark measures label-free error
ranking, so nothing here is a leaderboard result and nothing competes with a published number. The suite is used as a
task set, which is exactly what is needed: it converts "the margin ranks errors on the testbeds we chose" into "the
margin ranks errors on a suite somebody else fixed".

Design. 24 of the 25 tasks, in two families the protocol treats differently because the data do.

  Classification, 17 tasks, one pooled embedding and one label per sample, so the graded unit is the sample:
  m_eurosat, m_brick_kiln, m_forestnet, m_so2sat (GEO-Bench), awf_landsat/sentinel1/sentinel2, nandi_landsat/
  sentinel1/sentinel2, six cropharvest variants, breizhcrops. Two to seventeen classes, 200 to 122,614 samples.
  Segmentation, 7 tasks, dense embeddings on a patch grid, so the graded unit is the 4-px window as everywhere here:
  mados, sen1floods11, pastis_sentinel1/sentinel2/sentinel1_sentinel2, m_cashew_plant, m_sa_crop_type (GEO-Bench).

  m_bigearthnet is excluded and the reason is recorded rather than left out: its labels are multi-label, 43 binary
  tags per sample, so a top-1-minus-top-2 margin is not defined on it without inventing a convention this project has
  never tested.

  The probe is Ai2's own linear recipe at their published settings, fitted on their train split and reported on their
  test split. Rankers are the margin, one minus top-1 and predictive entropy; the controls are the distance of a
  sample's embedding from the training set's mean embedding, which uses no labels and no probe, and the rarity of the
  predicted class, which uses the decision and nothing else.

  The unit of the headline is the TASK. Per task the protocol produces an excess AURC for every ranker and every
  control; across tasks a one-sided exact sign test asks on how many of the 24 the margin beats the best control. That
  is the generality claim, and it is the one a reader who suspects testbed selection actually wants.

Preregistered (one-sided, decided before the first run):
  P1  the margin beats the best no-model control on at least 18 of the 24 tasks (exact sign test over tasks, p < 0.05).
  P2  it is not a property of one task family: the margin beats the best control on at least 13 of the 17
      classification tasks and at least 6 of the 7 segmentation tasks, each tested separately.
  P3  exp68's lesson generalises beyond the one task it was found on. There the ordering of the model signals inverted
      when the probe had memorised its fit set: the margin went from last of four to the front once regularisation was
      chosen on held-out ground. So across these 24 tasks the margin's advantage over predictive entropy is smaller on
      the tasks whose probe has the larger generalisation gap, measured as train accuracy minus test accuracy, with the
      tasks split at the median gap and compared by an exact sign test.
  Falsification. P1 fails if the margin loses to a control that sees no model on a third or more of a suite this
  project did not assemble, which would confine every ranking result here to testbeds chosen with knowledge of the
  answer. P2 fails if the result belongs to one family, in which case the claim must be narrowed to that family by
  name. P3 fails if the signal ordering is unrelated to how well the probe generalises, which would make exp68's
  finding a property of LUCAS rather than of probes, and the warning now on the front page would have to come off it.
  Stated predictions, not tested: accuracy spans a wide range across the suite and the margin's lead is not a function
  of it; the two-class tasks give the least room for a margin and are where the ranking should be weakest.

Caveats carried into the record. The embeddings are Ai2's, extracted with their settings, so this inherits whatever
their extraction did and is not an independent implementation of their models. The splits are theirs, and where a task
has a small test split the per-task excess AURC is noisy, which is why the headline is a count over tasks and not a
pooled number. Several tasks share a source (three AWF sensors, three nandi sensors, six cropharvest variants, three
PASTIS variants), so the 24 are not 24 independent datasets and the sign test over them overstates independence; the
count by distinct SOURCE is reported beside it.
