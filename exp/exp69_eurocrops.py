"""exp69: EuroCrops, a dense crop map from farmers' declarations, and the first temporal difference labelled on both sides.

Why. Two things this repository has never had, and the second is the reason the experiment is worth running.

The reference is administrative. EuroCrops harmonises the parcel declarations farmers make to their national paying
agency, so the label is neither photointerpretation (Sen1Floods11, GEOID-Flood, Dynamic World) nor another model's output
(DFC2020's random forest) nor a field visit (LUCAS, exp68). It is a legal declaration of what was sown, made by the
person who sowed it, for money. Its failure modes are therefore unlike every other reference here: it is right about
crop identity and can be wrong about extent, timing and whether the declared crop was actually planted.

And both sides of the time axis are labelled. Every temporal comparison in this repository so far has had truth for at
most one date: exp60's two flood periods are graded against one event mask, and exp68's two acquisitions are graded
against a survey made on one day, so its "neither side is right" cell absorbs both genuine model failure and the
reference simply not describing the other date. EuroCrops ships one file per region per year, and a parcel that appears
in both years carries a declared crop in each. So `oe_inferencex.compare`'s graded block becomes fully determined, and
one quantity that has been missing throughout becomes measurable: **the floor for a two-date change rate**. exp68's audit
made the point sharply, that the probe-reseed rate answers a different question, whether the head is stable, while the
right null for "the map changed between two dates" is how often the map changes where the ground did not. Windows whose
declared crop is identical in both years give that null directly, and windows whose declared crop changed give the signal
it should be read against.

Design. Data: EuroCropsV2 GeoParquet from the JRC open-data mirror, CC BY 4.0, EPSG:3035, joined on `original_code` to
the EuroCrops project's own HCAT mapping on GitHub, which the JRC files do not carry. Three regions, chosen because their
join rate is high and their parcel sizes differ by an order of magnitude: Austria, Denmark and Slovenia. Spain was
dropped after its codes failed to join at all and its single file proved to be 11 GB over 17 million parcels.

  Unit. The 4-px window, as everywhere else here, not the parcel: the median Austrian parcel is 3,632 sqm and the median
  Danish one 24,026 sqm, so a parcel spans several windows and a dense label map is the honest representation. Chips are
  64 px at 10 m centred on a sampled parcel, with every parcel intersecting the chip burned in, so the label map is dense
  wherever farmland is declared and unlabelled elsewhere; a window is graded when three quarters of its sixteen pixels
  carry one class.
  Classes. HCAT3 names, reduced per region to the classes holding most of the declared area plus one "other crop" bin,
  because a probe on this much data cannot carry the 96 to 133 classes the mappings define.
  Imagery. Sentinel-2 L2A from the Planetary Computer, the least-cloudy scene in the growing season of each declaration
  year, with the baseline 04.00 BOA offset removed as in exp68 so digital numbers match the convention the encoder's
  normaliser expects.
  Model. OlmoEarth v1 Base frozen, fp32, with Ai2's linear segmentation probe recipe; weight decay and epochs tuned on
  regions held out of the fit set, never on the report regions, which exp68 showed is not optional: an overfit head there
  reversed the ordering of the confidence signals.
  Splits. By parcel-grid cell, so no chip's neighbourhood appears in both fit and report.

  Part A, ranking. The margin against entropy, one minus top-1, the boundary-first order and the no-model controls, on
  the graded windows of the report cells, scored as everywhere here: excess AURC, a per-cell sign test, error capture at
  5, 10 and 20 percent.
  Part B, two years with truth on both sides. The same windows read through both years' imagery, compared with
  `oe_inferencex.compare`, and split by what the declarations say: windows whose declared crop is the same in both years,
  and windows where it changed. This gives the labelled null and the labelled signal, `which_side` with a real "neither",
  and the cross-tab of the two years' errors.

Preregistered (one-sided):
  P1  the ranking holds on a declaration-derived dense reference: on the report cells the margin's excess AURC is at
      least 0.01 below the best no-model control, pooled, and lower on more grid cells than not (p < 0.05), in every
      region.
  P2  a two-date difference is mostly real change, not model instability: the decision-change rate on windows whose
      declared crop changed between the two years is at least twice the rate on windows whose declared crop did not,
      in every region, and the latter is the floor that exp68 could only bound by its most stable class.
  P3  truth on both sides makes the comparison decidable: among windows where the two years' decisions differ and both
      years are labelled, the share where neither side is right is below one half, so `which_side` is informative rather
      than dominated by the case it cannot resolve.
  Falsification. P1 fails if the margin loses to a pixel index, which would confine exp68's result to references that
  describe land cover rather than crop identity. P2 fails if the unchanged-crop change rate is within half the
  changed-crop rate, which would say a two-date difference on this task is mostly the model moving rather than the ground
  moving, and would put exp60's and exp68's difference rates in a harsher light than either reported. P3 fails if the
  undecidable share is at or above one half, which would say that labelling both sides does not rescue the graded block,
  and the honest report would then be that the comparison module tells an operator where two inferences differ and not
  which to believe.
  Stated predictions, not tested: Denmark the most accurate region, its fields being an order of magnitude larger than
  Slovenia's; grassland and cereals the most accurate classes; the unchanged-crop change rate between 0.05 and 0.20,
  above the probe-reseed floor and well below exp68's 0.31 on land cover.

Caveats carried into the record. A declaration is not an observation: a farmer declares a parcel and its crop for
subsidy, so extent is a cadastral boundary rather than what the sensor sees, a declared crop may fail or be replaced, and
catch crops and multiple harvests inside one year are invisible. The HCAT harmonisation is the EuroCrops project's, not
ours, and its join leaves 0.4% of Austrian, 0.1% of Danish and 14.7% of Slovenian parcels unmapped, measured on the
run, and those parcels' pixels are left unlabelled rather than guessed; the unmapped set is not a random sample of
crops, so for Slovenia in particular the share is a bias risk and not harmless attrition. Slovakia ships no licence with EuroCropsV2 and Spain's SIGPAC forbids redistribution without added
value, so the mirror's blanket CC BY 4.0 may not bind every national source; the three regions used here are not among
those two. Austria's mapping file covers 2021 only and is applied to its other year as well, which the run asserts is
safe by checking the join rate per year and dropping any year below 0.9. A parcel present in both years may have been
split or merged, so the two years' geometries are intersected rather than assumed identical.

Inputs: the JRC parquets (about 0.3 to 1.1 GB per region-year) and the GitHub HCAT mappings, cached under
/scratch/.../hf/eurocrops; Sentinel-2 L2A from the Planetary Computer. Run with ~/olmoearth_inferenceX/.venv and
PYTHONPATH=/scratch/.../pylibs, since GDAL here has no Parquet driver and pyarrow is unpacked there.
Stages: --stage labels (build the dense label rasters and the chip list), --stage fetch (imagery), --stage analyze.
Outputs: exp/out/exp69_summary.json, exp/out/exp69_eurocrops.csv, exp/out/exp69_windows.npz.
--smoke: synthetic parcels and chips, no network, _smoke outputs.
