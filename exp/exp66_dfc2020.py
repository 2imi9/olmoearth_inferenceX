"""exp66: the protocol on DFC2020, eight-class land cover, both sensors, our own encoder, and two references of different quality.

Why. Ai2 (Patrick Johnson, 2026-09-11) suggested DFC2020 as a labelled evaluation set: Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 at 10 m
over the same scenes with a 10 m reference, where every other dense testbed here is binary flood water (Sen1Floods11,
GEOID-Flood) or comes as Ai2's published embeddings rather than our own encoder pass (MADOS, PASTIS in exp54 and exp63).
It adds three things at once: a new dataset our encoder has never seen, eight land-cover classes, and the sensor axis on a
land task rather than on water (exp60's sensor axis was flood water; exp63's was PASTIS through their embeddings).

It also carries something no other testbed here does, and it is the reason this experiment has a third part. The DFC2020
reference is NOT hand-drawn, despite how the contest is usually described: it is an iterated Google Earth Engine random
forest over Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, spectral indices, the 500 m MODIS map and FROM-GLC10, with a published overall
accuracy of 82.4% and average precision 76.3% (Yokoya, Ghamisi, Hansch, Schmitt; verified 2026-09-11). The same patches
also ship the 500 m MODIS labels the contest called weak. So one dataset carries two references of KNOWN and different
quality over identical pixels, which is the clean instrument this repository has never had for its oldest caveat: that
reference-product labels flatter boundary-type signals (exp18, docs/method/protocol.md). Every number here is therefore
graded twice, against the 10 m reference and against the 500 m one, and the third preregistration is about the gap.

Design. Data: the ungated HuggingFace mirror `125oii/dfc2020` (byte counts reproduce the IEEE DataPort manifest; IEEE
DataPort itself is not scriptable, single sign-on plus manual approval). The validation split (986 patches) fits the
probes, the test split (5,128) is reported, which is the convention in the literature; both carry the 10 m reference, and
the two splits differ in class composition, so this is a shift, not an i.i.d. split, and it is stated not corrected.
Patches are 256 x 256 at 10 m, cut into sixteen 64 px chips; the encoder reads the 60 px crop of each, giving 15 x 15
windows of 4 px. Sentinel-2 is L1C top-of-atmosphere, 13 bands, gathered into the encoder's twelve (B10 dropped) with
digital numbers unchanged; Sentinel-1 is already sigma-nought in decibels as float64, cast and passed through. The
encoder is OlmoEarth v1 Base, frozen; the probe is their linear recipe in fp32 (exp54's port), fitted per arm and per
seed. Arms: Sentinel-2 alone, Sentinel-1 alone, and both together (the pooled tokens of the two modalities concatenated),
two probe seeds each, the second seed giving the noise floor of a difference rate.

  Part A, ranking. Windows are ranked by the model's own margin (top-1 minus top-2 window probability), against
  predictive entropy, the boundary-first order (exp36), the no-model NDWI level control computed from the pixels, and
  cross-arm disagreement. Scored as everywhere here: pooled excess AURC, a one-sided per-patch sign test, error capture
  at 5, 10 and 20 percent.
  Part B, comparison. oe_inferencex.compare on identical windows: Sentinel-2 against Sentinel-1 (the sensor axis),
  Sentinel-2 against the joint arm, and seed 0 against seed 1 within each arm (the floor). Cue enrichment on the
  differing windows (boundary, bottom margin quintile, top entropy quintile), which side is right with the multi-class
  neither, the cross-tab, per patch with compare.over_groups.
  Part C, the two references. Every ranker of part A is scored again against the 500 m MODIS reference on the same
  windows, after the contest's IGBP to DFC remapping.

Preregistered (one-sided):
  P1  on every arm the model's own margin beats the no-model NDWI control against the 10 m reference: pooled excess AURC
      lead at least 0.001 and a per-patch sign test p < 0.05 (three tests).
  P2  the sensor difference is real and located: Sentinel-2 against Sentinel-1 differs on at least ten times the share of
      windows that a second probe seed does, and its differing windows carry the boundary cue more than twice as often as
      the agreeing ones.
  P3  the weaker reference flatters the boundary order: the boundary-first order's lead over the margin is larger when
      graded against the 500 m MODIS reference than against the 10 m reference, pooled, and larger on more patches than
      not (p < 0.05).
  Falsification. P1 fails if any arm's margin does not beat a pixel index, which would say the ranking does not transfer
  to eight-class land cover under our own encoder. P2 fails if the sensor difference is within ten times the seed floor
  (it would then be noise) or is not boundary-located (the atlas finding would not hold on land cover). P3 fails if the
  gap is zero or negative, which would retire exp18's caveat rather than confirm it; a negative gap would be the more
  interesting result and must be reported as such.
  Stated predictions, not tested: the joint arm beats both single-sensor arms on accuracy; Sentinel-1 alone trails
  Sentinel-2 alone by roughly ten points of mean intersection over union; the boundary cue is weaker here than on
  Sen1Floods11 and stronger than on PASTIS, since eight classes sit between two and nineteen.

Caveats carried into the record. The imagery is L1C top-of-atmosphere while the encoder's modality is Sentinel-2 L2A
surface reflectance: the inputs are off-manifold and a linear probe absorbs only a constant offset. The split zips carry
no real georeferencing (identity transform, nominal EPSG:4326), so windows are addressed by patch and pixel, never by
map coordinates. The reference's own errors are correlated with what a linear probe on these features learns, so a
"captured error" here includes reference error; that is the point of part C, not a flaw to hide. Publishing a DFC2020
number requires case-by-case approval from the IEEE GRSS IADF technical committee and TUM under the contest terms:
running and recording internally is fine, and any paper use needs that approval first.

Inputs: the mirror (about 10.4 GB, cached under $HF_HOME/dfc2020). Run with ~/oe12/.venv (rasterio and the encoder).
Outputs: exp/out/exp66_summary.json, exp/out/exp66_dfc2020.csv (one row per arm and reference, one per compared pair),
exp/out/exp66_masks.npz (window decisions, margins, entropy and both references for a capped sample of patches).
--smoke: synthetic patches on CPU, no download, _smoke outputs.
