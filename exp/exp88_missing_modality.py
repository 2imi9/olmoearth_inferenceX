"""exp88: when a modality is missing at inference, does the confidence fall with the accuracy?

Preregistered in docs/plan/missing_modality.md; read that page first, this file is the run. A probe trained on the
S1+S2 embeddings of Ai2's train split is read, with no refit, on the S1+S2, the S1-only and the S2-only embeddings of
the same test windows: full input, optical missing (clouds), radar missing. Three task families carry the same units
under the three inputs: PASTIS (primary), CropHarvest China 6 (replication), CropHarvest Togo 12 (reported, not
graded). OlmoEarth Base; OlmoEarth Large as a replication when its files are cached.

    python exp/exp88_missing_modality.py --smoke             # numpy only: synthetic embeddings, both synthetic cases
    python exp/exp88_missing_modality.py --smoke-torch       # the real probe code on synthetic tensors (needs torch)
    python exp/exp88_missing_modality.py --check-alignment   # identifiers, shapes and split sizes of the real files only
    python exp/exp88_missing_modality.py                     # the full run; refused until the plan page says frozen

What is reused, not rewritten. The probes are the record's: exp54.train_probe (segmentation, fp32, 50 epochs, the
task's probe learning rate from exp54.TASK_LR, 0.01 for PASTIS S1+S2 on Base; Ai2's per-size file for Large through
suite_regression.set_probe_lrs) and exp73._train_cls_probe (classification, Ai2's linear recipe at 0.1, as exp70
fitted every classification task). Window probabilities, decisions, majority labels and validity are
exp75.seg_window_probs (exp54's windows, returned in full); the embedding under each window is
exp74.window_embeddings; the readings, the two no-model controls and their scores are suite_regression.score_units
(exp70.readings_from_probs, exp73.controls_chunked, exp70.score_task, exp70.best_control), so "the margin beats the
best no-model control" is computed exactly as the record computes it. The intervals are oe_inferencex.estimate's.
The loaders are suite_regression.load_task and exp54.load_theirs, the per-unit export format is exp78's in spirit.

Measures, per family and condition, on the same valid units in the same order:
  1. the error rate;
  2. the median margin of the errors and of the correct units, and their shift from full input (also the median of
     the paired per-unit shift, and how many errors are new under the condition);
  3. confident errors: the share of the condition's errors whose margin is at or above the median margin of the
     correct units under full input (the threshold is per family and per probe seed);
  4. the margin's AUROC for errors, its excess AURC, each control's, and its lead over the best control;
  5. on PASTIS, a mixed map: floor(N/2) of the N test tiles drawn with numpy's default_rng(88) take the
     optical-missing units, the rest keep full input. (a) the 5% review set by margin: the share of the cloudy
     part's errors inside it, beside the cloudy part's share of all errors and of the review set's errors; (b) 2,000
     random samples of 300 windows (default_rng(0), exp78's draw seed): the pooled estimate against the cloudy
     part's true rate, and the per-condition (post-stratified) intervals' coverage of each part's true rate.
Predictions, graded on OlmoEarth Base at probe seed 0 (seeds 1-4 and Large are read the same way and reported):
  P1  PASTIS: error rate under optical missing - under full >= 5 points.
  P2  PASTIS: confident-error share under optical missing - under full >= 5 points. If it fails, the confidence
      tracks the lost information; that is reported as the answer.
  P3  under optical missing the margin's lead over the best no-model control is > 0 on PASTIS and on China 6.
  P4  mixed map: |pooled estimate - cloudy part's rate| >= 5 points, and each part's interval covers its true rate
      on >= 93% of the 2,000 draws.
Every threshold is compared with a tolerance of 1e-12, so a float difference that prints as 0.0500 is 0.05.

Interpretations of the plan page, each flagged in the commit that added this file; none changes a threshold:
  a. P3's "best no-model control" is the record's: the better (lower excess AURC) of exp70's two controls, the
     embedding distance (exp74's window embedding, distance from the mean of the probe's own S1+S2 training
     embeddings) and the class rarity, chosen per condition. The lead over the embedding distance alone is
     reported beside it as `reading_embedding_distance_only`, since the page names that control in parentheses.
     A control measured from the mean of the condition's own (S1-only) training embeddings was not computed.
  b. P2 names no task; it is graded on PASTIS, the primary task, like P1. China 6's reading of P1 and P2 is
     reported as replication.
  c. P4's "off by at least 5 points" is graded on the pooled estimator's bias over the 2,000 draws (mean pooled
     estimate minus the cloudy part's true rate), the smaller and so the more conservative of the readings; the
     mean absolute error and the share of single draws off by 5 points are reported beside it.
  d. P4's stratified estimate post-stratifies the one random sample of 300 by condition. Each part's interval is
     the package's interval for a random sample (estimate_error_rate, design "random": the exact hypergeometric
     interval) on that part's labelled windows, with the part's size as the population. A draw that labels no
     window of a part counts as not covering. The finite-population Wilson interval exp78 and exp79 graded is
     reported beside it, and so is the post-stratified whole-map estimate.
  e. The mixed map is drawn over all N test tiles, including tiles with no valid window; the probe reads each tile
     alone (a linear map per token, interpolated within the tile), so a whole tile's units under optical missing
     are exactly the optical-missing condition's units for that tile, and no probe is rerun for the mixed map.
  f. OlmoEarth Large runs when the four files the design reads are cached for every family (its S1+S2 train split
     and the three test splits), at the same five probe seeds as Base, and is reported beside it, never graded.
  g. --smoke replaces the fitted probe by a fixed numpy stand-in (a softmax over class prototypes), because the
     package's environment has no torch; everything after the probabilities is the code the full run uses. The
     fitting and loading code is exercised by --smoke-torch, which the cluster job runs before either real mode:
     exp54's windows reproduced, then the alignment check and the full run (run_all, past the freeze guard only)
     end to end on a synthetic Hub cache read offline, for both encoders.
  h. The full run refuses to start unless the plan page's status line says frozen ("**Status: frozen ...", the
     form agent_trial_v3.md took), so no run on real embeddings can precede the freeze by accident.
     --check-alignment is allowed before it and reads only identifiers (the labels and any other per-unit key a
     file carries, compared in order and reported by digest, never tabulated), shapes, dtypes and split sizes; the
     embeddings are opened memory-mapped where torch allows and no value of theirs enters any computation.
  i. A reported check, not a gate: the full condition's accuracy at each seed beside the record's accuracy of the
     same S1+S2 probe (exp79's per-seed export; exp70 for Base at seed 0).

Outputs. exp/out/exp88_alignment.json (--check-alignment); exp/out/exp88_summary.json and exp/out/exp88_units.npz
(per-unit margin and error for every seed, top probability and decision at seed 0; if the file would exceed about
60 MB, Large's replicate seeds are dropped first, then Base's); _smoke variants from --smoke. --out-dir moves them.
