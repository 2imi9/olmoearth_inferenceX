"""exp89: do the review order, the estimate and the certificate hold on Ai2's other public fine-tuned models?

Preregistered in docs/plan/finetuned_checkpoints.md; read that page first, this file is the run. Four arms, as the
owner's decision of 1 October 2026 amends the page:
  mangrove  allenai/OlmoEarth-v1-FT-Mangrove-Base, graded on P1 to P5. Not run until Ai2 shares its validation split:
            the public mangrove.tar holds 100,000 points and 2,000 task areas, with no split and no imagery. Every mode
            that scores a window reports it as not run while ARMS["mangrove"]["split_source"] is None;
  nandi     frozen under the same thresholds and not run: its checkpoint and dataset return 401 on the Hub. Every
            mode reports it as not run unless both become readable and their revisions are pinned here;
  awf       FT-AWF on Ai2's 344 validation points (exp21's), REPORT-ONLY: every measure, control, cluster and study,
            every number and interval, and no verdict on any prediction;
  fld       allenai/OlmoEarth-v1-FT-ForestLossDriver-Base on Ai2's validation windows (options.split "val", 109 in
            Ai2's confusion matrix), REPORT-ONLY as arm A.
For the report-only arms the accuracy gate is an alignment check: it is reported with its tolerance, and a check
outside it labels every number "replica not aligned". Nothing in their outputs is a pass or a fail.

    python exp/exp89_finetuned_checkpoints.py --smoke                      # S1: numpy only, synthetic units
    python exp/exp89_finetuned_checkpoints.py --smoke-torch                # S2 code on a synthetic tar and checkpoint

    python exp/exp89_finetuned_checkpoints.py --inventory --arm fld --tar T  # files, keys, windows and labels per split

What is reused, not rewritten. Every statistic is the package's: the ranking measures are oe_inferencex.metrics
(aurc_expected, excess_aurc, oracle_aurc, capture_at_budget_expected, attainable_ceiling, weighted_auroc with unit
weights as exp70 reads the AUROC, selective_accuracy, expected_calibration_error); the AURC bootstrap is
oe_inferencex.stats.cluster_bootstrap_difference, and the capture bootstrap draws the same resamples in the same order;
the estimate and the certificate are oe_inferencex.estimate (sample_for_estimation, estimate_error_rate,
exact_coverage_srs, certify_zone, zone_order, min_labels_to_certify), called unchanged. The confidence is
oe_inferencex.assess.assess_prediction at patch 1 with form "top1" on the trained channels; the logit margin is the
same call with form "margin". Arm A reads its windows with oe_inferencex.awf (list_windows, given the root of the
pinned tar extracted under E89_DATA, and load_window_full) and runs exp21's forward pass (logits_grid) unchanged. Its
crop is this file's crop_at, which applies exp21's rule at H = W = 63 (tested against exp21's numbers). Only the
checkpoint is loaded here, at the pinned revision, and the encoder is built
from OlmoEarth v1-Base's config.json at the revision the page names (ENCODER_REVISIONS).

Interpretations of the plan page, each flagged in the commit that added this file; none changes a threshold:
  a. Mangrove's label rule "a window is kept when its valid label pixels all agree and none is 0" is read as: all
     pixels of the 2x2 block (after rslearn's centre Pad to 2) carry the same class, from 1 to 3. The gate's pixel
     micro accuracy is over every valid (non-zero) label pixel of every validation window with imagery, kept or not,
     as Ai2's metric counts them.
  b. The logit margin is taken over the trained channels, like the graded top-1 probability, so the estimate's
     confidence design stratifies by it (margin quintiles) and allocates by the top-1 probability, as the command line's
     default `sample --logits` does. A window whose top two include the untrained channel is counted and reported.
  c. The best informative control is the lowest-AURC signal among K2, K3a, K3b, each K4 index and K5, each counted
     as one candidate.
  d. P3's one-sided 95% lower bound is the 5th percentile of the cluster bootstrap of the capture difference at 10%.
  e. The estimate draws: SeedSequence([89, arm, design, B]).generate_state(R) gives one seed per draw; arm is
     mangrove 0, nandi 1, awf 2, fld 3 and design random 0, confidence 1. The certificate reuses the random design's
     draws.
     A draw whose zone is certified and whose zone's true error rate exceeds alpha is a violation; a draw that
     certifies nothing, or that the review-set guard refuses, counts as coverage 0 and no violation (refusals are
     counted). c*(alpha) is the largest grid coverage whose zone, in that order, has a true error rate of at most alpha.
  f. K3's features are z-scored with the training split's mean and standard deviation before the MLP. The page fixes
     the network and the optimiser; it says nothing on feature scaling, and the empty-month count (0 to 12) would
     otherwise sit on another scale than the normalised bands. Nothing is fitted on the validation split.
  g. K4's NDVI controls for Nandi and AWF use exp21's formula (all twelve months, (B08 - B04) / max(B08 + B04, 1e-6)),
     so AWF's temporal control equals exp21's recorded one. The 3x3 control is the spatial standard deviation of each
     pixel's median NDVI over the months, in the 3x3 block around the label pixel. Mangrove's indices use the valid
     months only, as the page defines f over valid months.
  h. K5's threshold, B02 above 0.2 reflectance, is 2,000 in the harmonised L2A digital numbers the tar stores. The
     owner confirmed it with the other thresholds; the page's marker now says so.
  i. Arm A's gate is read as Nandi's: within 2.0 points of Ai2's 89.5% for AWF (exp21's replica was 1.4 points off),
     two-sided. Since the amendment of 1 October 2026 it is arm A's alignment check (see j). Agreement with exp21's
     recorded predictions is reported in the run's summary, not in the gate file, which holds counts and accuracy only.
  j. The gate counts attempts: at most three in all, the first and two retries. A third failed attempt closes the gate
     and nothing is graded. A passed gate is not rerun. Each attempt is appended to a ledger before the gate file is
     written. On the cluster the ledger lives outside the git checkout (E89_GATE_LEDGER), so the job's hard reset cannot
     roll the count back: a gate file behind its ledger is restored from it, and one that holds an attempt the ledger
     lacks is refused. The run checks the pass itself (require_gate): made on a frozen page, on the pinned checkpoint,
     and held by the ledger. For the report-only arms (A and F) the same machinery is an alignment check: an attempt
     records "aligned" (true or false) where a graded arm records "pass", the file says "aligned" or "replica not
     aligned", and the run needs a recorded check, not an aligned one. A check outside the tolerance labels every
     number of the run "replica not aligned"; a second or third attempt is allowed after a fix to the replica.
  k. --smoke runs the estimate study at the run's R = 2,000 draws but certifies on the first SMOKE_DRAWS of the random
     design's draws and bootstraps SMOKE_BOOT resamples, so it finishes in under a minute; the run uses R = 2,000
     and 2,000 resamples everywhere, as the page fixes.
  l. Imagery is read from the tar only. There is no fetch mode yet: if the inventory finds no Sentinel-2 layers in
     mangrove.tar, a fetch mode, and the gate's 1.0-point tolerance for refetched imagery, come before freezing. The
     tar's size makes that likely: 62,433,280 bytes is 121,940 tar blocks, and a 2x2 window with 12 item groups takes
     about 60 to 200 of them, so the tar can carry imagery for at most about 2,000 windows, not the page's expected
     12,500 validation windows. A validation window with no completed item group is dropped and counted (the gate
     records the count), and the gate refuses, recording no attempt, when no kept window has imagery.
  m. A window with fewer than 12 completed item groups is run with its own number of timesteps (batched by it), which
     is what rslearn's masked pooling over the missing timesteps reduces to; the inventory and the run count them.
  n. Nandi's polygon id is looked for under the option keys in NANDI_POLYGON_KEYS, a guess until its windows are seen,
     and its label source under the option key "source".
Arm F's readings (added with the amendment of 1 October 2026; the page marks them proposed, owner to confirm):
  o. The population is rslearn's validation set as Ai2's training config reads it: every window, in any group, whose
     options.split is "val", whose eight image layers (pre_sentinel2 and .1 to .3, post_sentinel2 and .1 to .3) and
     label layer carry rslearn's completed marker (check_window with load_all_layers), and whose label is valid. The
     label is ClassificationTask's: the first feature of layers/label/data.geojson whose new_label is one of the ten
     classes (skip_unknown_categories, allow_invalid). label.json and old_label are never read.
     options.olmoearth_evals_split belongs to the paper's evaluation, not to the checkpoint, and is never read.
  p. The model's input is rslearn's: the eight layers in the config's order, 12 bands each in OlmoEarth's order,
     Pad(64, center) on the raw values, then OlmoEarth's normalisation. SimpleTimeSeries(image_channels=48,
     groups=[[0], [1]]) runs the encoder once on the four pre layers and once on the four post layers (timestamps day
     1, months 0 to 3, 2024, both passes), mean-pools each over timesteps and band sets, and concatenates pre then
     post (1,536 channels on a 16x16 map at patch 4). The head is rslearn's PoolingDecoder (conv 3x3 to 128 + ReLU,
     amax over the map, Linear 512 + ReLU twice, Linear to 10), loaded strictly from model.decoder.0. Ai2's
     validation used random flips and bf16 autocast; the replica uses no flip and fp32. The alignment check records
     the accuracy under each of the four flips beside it, and S2 reports the bf16 difference on training windows.
  q. K3's features (128 per window) come from the 64-px crop the model sees. Per stack (pre, post): the per-pixel
     median over its non-empty timesteps (a timestep is empty when every pixel and band is 0), its 12 bands plus NDVI
     (B08, B04) and NBR (B08, B12); their spatial mean and standard deviation over the crop and their mean over the
     centre 16 px (42 per stack); then post minus pre of those 42; then each stack's count of empty timesteps. K4 is
     the loss signal at the centre: minus the NDVI drop and minus the NBR drop from the pre to the post composite (a
     small or negative drop is suspect). K5 counts the eight timesteps that are empty or whose centre mean B02
     exceeds 2,000. K3 is fitted on every training window (options.split "train") that passes o's layer rule.
  r. The bootstrap's cluster is the 1 degree cell of the window's centre. The window group cannot be one: Ai2's split
     script gives validation windows to four groups only, and four clusters cannot carry a bootstrap. The group is the
     stratum of the by-stratum report.
  s. The tar is on Google Cloud Storage, not the Hub. It is pinned by its object generation, size and MD5 (an HTTP
     HEAD on 1 October 2026). The job downloads it with a resumable curl; verify_tar hashes it once (MD5 and SHA-256
     in one pass), refuses it unless the size and the MD5 match the pin, and records the SHA-256, which is checked
     too once it is pinned here. extract_layers then streams it once and writes only what the run reads: the eight
     image layers, the label layer, every window's top-level files and the dataset's config. Every other layer
     (Landsat, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 groups .4 and .5, the masks) is counted and skipped. Groups are not filtered:
     the split is read per window, and group names are not verified until the inventory.
  t. Certification for arm F is studied at alpha 0.10 and 0.15 (Ai2's error rate is 23.9%). At 109 windows neither
     budget (300, 1,000) fits, so its estimate and certify cells are reported as not run; c*(alpha) from all labels
     is reported for both orders.
Arm A's data (fixed with the amendment): arm A reads the pinned AWF tar the job downloads and extracts under
E89_DATA/awf, never the old data/awf (exp21's location, which the scratch purge has partly removed). Every arm's
extraction keeps a manifest; a file the purge removed later is found before anything is read, and the tar is
extracted again.

Safety, not interpretation. The checkpoint is checked against its pinned sha256, a local --ckpt included, and loaded
with weights_only=True; any other global it pickles becomes an inert stub class, and a global naming code execution is
refused. The scored checkpoint's sha256 is recorded in the replica's info and in every gate attempt.
predict_population is the one function that scores validation windows, and it refuses before the page is frozen;
compute_units and run_arm refuse without a verified gate pass (graded arms) or a verified alignment check (report-only
arms).

Outputs (exp/out): exp89_inventory_<arm>.json (--inventory), exp89_s2_<arm>.json (--smoke-torch --real),
exp89_gate_<arm>.json (--gate) and its ledger exp89_gate_<arm>.ledger.jsonl (in E89_GATE_LEDGER when set, else beside
it), exp89_units_<arm>.npz and exp89_summary.json (the run); exp89_summary_smoke.json from --smoke. --out-dir moves
them. Hub downloads go to HF_HOME (scratch on the cluster) and are checked against the pinned sha256 before use; the
tar is extracted under --data. Arm F's tar is given with --tar (the job downloads it) and checked against its pinned
size and MD5.
