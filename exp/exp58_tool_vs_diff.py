"""exp58: is the comparison tool better than the raw diff? Three label-free readings of a disagreement set, graded.

Why. exp57 measured the difference between two inferences of the same scene and showed where it sits; the question a
user asks next is whether the package tells them anything a raw disagreement map does not. A raw diff says which windows
changed and nothing else: every disagreement window is equally suspect, no side is preferred, and on two dates every
change is change. The package reads the same disagreement set label-free in three ways, and each reading is a testable
prediction about the labels.

Design. The pairs and grids of exp57 (exp57's loaders): crop offset 0 against 2, v1 against v1.2, the S2 head against
the S1 head, the frozen head against FT-S2 v1 (fine-tuned once more with exp52's recipe), each on Bolivia and the
multi-region test split of Sen1Floods11 on the W1 grid; the seven encoders against OlmoEarth Base on Ai2's embeddings
and probe (their test split); the pre-event S2 head against the post-event S1 head per GEOID-Flood event. On every
pair the two inferences are probability maps, so each side has a margin |p - 0.5| on every window. Readings, on the
windows where the two decisions differ:
  resolution  the tool believes the side with the larger margin (on a binary task the mean-probability decision). Graded:
              the share of disagreement windows where the chosen side matches the label. Baselines: the raw diff, which
              prefers no side (a coin flip, 0.5 in expectation, since exactly one side is right on a binary window);
              always the first inference; always the second. Recorded alongside, not preregistered: the same rule on
              rank-normalised margins (each side's margin as its midrank percentile over the testbed's valid windows),
              which removes a scale difference between two probability maps.
  targeting   the tool orders the disagreement windows by the first inference's own confidence, least confident first;
              the raw diff has no order. Graded: the share of the first inference's errors inside the least confident
              half of the set (random order captures 0.5 in expectation), and at 20%.
  change      on GEOID-Flood the two heads predict different things (permanent water before, water after the event), so a
              disagreement is change or error. The tool reads a window where both sides are confident (each margin at
              least CONFIDENT_MARGIN = 0.25, that is both probabilities at least 0.75 from the other side's class) as
              change; the raw diff reads every disagreement as change.
              Graded: the share of flooded-by-label windows among the both-confident disagreements against the share
              among all disagreements, pooled and per event.
  stability   descriptive: with three head draws (exp57's), the resolution rule on the disagreement windows that persist
              across all draws against those that appear in draw 0 only.
Per-tile and per-event tests use compare.over_groups on the groups with at least MIN_WINDOWS disagreement windows: a
one-sided exact sign test that the reading beats its baseline on more groups than not.

Preregistered (one-sided; the thresholds are what exp42's averaging gain and exp57's cross-tabs imply):
  P1  resolution beats the coin flip on every pair: the chosen side is right on at least 55% of the disagreement windows
      pooled, and on more tiles than not (p < 0.05), for the four Sen1Floods11 pairs on both testbeds and the seven
      encoder pairs (15 tests).
  P2  targeting beats the unordered set on every pair: the least confident half of the disagreement windows holds at
      least 55% of the first inference's errors pooled, and more than half on more tiles than not (p < 0.05); 15 tests.
  P3  on GEOID-Flood the both-confident disagreement windows are flooded at least 1.5 times as often as the disagreement
      windows as a whole, pooled over the 55 events, and more often on more events than not (p < 0.05; events with at
      least MIN_EVENT_WINDOWS disagreement windows).
  Falsification: P1 fails if any pair resolves at or below 55% or the per-tile test misses 0.05 (a margin rule would then
  be no better than the raw diff's silence on which side to believe); P2 fails likewise (the order would add nothing to
  the set); P3 fails if the ratio is below 1.5 or the event test misses (confidence on both sides would not separate
  change from error). Stated prediction, not tested: the resolution rule is more accurate on persistent than on
  transient disagreement windows for the three pairs with head draws.

Inputs. As exp57 (exp/out/exp18_feats.npz, data/floods, the v1 and v1.2 checkpoints, $HF_HOME/paper_embeddings,
$HF_HOME/geoid_flood/tree). Outputs. exp/out/exp58_summary.json (per pair and testbed the three readings with their
baselines and per-group tests, the stability split, prereg), exp/out/exp58_tool_vs_diff.csv (one row per pair x
testbed). --pairs selects pairs; a subset merges into the existing summary (the GEOID pair runs under the pinned venv).
Smoke as exp57's (CPU, no downloads).
