"""exp98: the record's re-run of Ai2's FT-AWF deployment configuration over the AWF project's request geometry (2023,
10 m, probabilities written), graded at Ai2's own AWF labels. It is not the map Ai2 published.

Preregistered in docs/plan/awf_deployment.md; read that page first, this file is the run. The map is the output of
olmoearth_run (Ai2's FT-AWF checkpoint and AWF configuration, re-run by the record's jobs with the segmentation task
writing its softmax), read by `oe-inferencex from-olmoearth` in parts (exp/jobs/e98_read.sh), one directory per part:

    scores_<EPSG>.tif           10 float32 bands, the softmax over the decoder's 10 channels, NaN where no window predicted
    condition_<EPSG>.tif        int32 on the same grid, the input condition of each pixel, -1 unrecorded
    olmoearth_conditions.json   names the condition codes ("codes": {code: name})
    burned_<EPSG>.tif           optional (exp/exp98_burned.py, Part H): int32, 1 burned in 2023, 0 not, -1 unrecorded
    burned_conditions.json      its codes' names

This file reads those files; it does not import oe_inferencex.olmoearth. Several directories are read as one map:
condition names are merged (a conflict is refused), a point in two grids takes the first that covers its pixel, and a
map pixel covered in two grids counts once.

    python exp/exp98_awf_deployment.py --smoke                     # synthetic inputs end to end; no real file is read
    python exp/exp98_awf_deployment.py --inventory --scores DIR [DIR ...] --labels WINDOWS   # counts only
    python exp/exp98_awf_deployment.py --scores DIR [DIR ...] --labels WINDOWS [--replica NPZ] [--deployment-dataset DS ...]

The parts (the page's names):
  A  reproduction (graded: P1, P2): the re-run map's accuracy at Ai2's validation points against exp89's replica on
     the same points (paired; P1 an equivalence test on the task-cluster bootstrap interval), with Ai2's 89.5% beside
     it, and how often the two give the same class;
  B  ranking (graded: P3, P4): how the deployed map's own confidence ranks its errors at those points;
  C  input condition (descriptive): errors by the condition layer's code at those points;
  D  inventory (counts): how many validation and training points fall inside the deployed area;
  E  where the points sit in the map (graded: P5; the rest descriptive): their confidence among the map's pixels, the
     map's class and condition shares beside theirs, and a reweighting that is reported, never graded;
  F  what a whole-map answer needs (report-only): `plan` for an error rate within +-5 points and for certify at
     alpha 0.10, and the sequential sample that would be labelled;
  G  inputs (report-only, with --deployment-dataset): the 10 m bands at each label pixel in the deployed dataset
     against the label window's own, and the two datasets' Sentinel-2 configuration;
  H  burned area (report-only, when every part directory holds exp/exp98_burned.py's burned_<EPSG>.tif): the map's
     40 m windows by MODIS burn code (the package's pool_condition), the deployed confidence's quartiles per code and
     each code's share of the least confident 10% of windows; Ai2's validation points by the burn code of their pixel,
     with errors per code. Descriptive, no verdict; absent layers are skipped with a note.

Readings fixed here (the page states each one):
  - A label is read as oe_inferencex.awf reads it: a window of group spatial_split whose label raster holds exactly one
    pixel other than the fill 9, with a class 0 to 8 (exp89's single_pixel_label on exp89's window list). Where
    oe_inferencex.awf imports (the encoder extra), its list_windows is run on the same directory and must agree.
  - A label's pixel on the score grid. The label raster's own georeference gives the centre of the labelled pixel in
    the window's CRS: (col + 0.5, row + 0.5) through its transform. In the scores' CRS that centre falls in exactly one
    score pixel, floor((X - X0) / a), floor((Y - Y0) / e) for the scores' north-up transform (a, 0, X0, 0, e, Y0): the
    score pixel that contains the label pixel's centre. When the CRSs are equal the centre is used as it is; otherwise
    it is reprojected (rasterio.warp.transform) and the point is counted as reprojected. rslearn writes both the label
    windows and the deployed windows on integer pixel bounds of the same 10 m lattice of a CRS, so with equal CRSs the
    centre sits at the middle of a score pixel, offset 0.5 from its edges; the largest departure from 0.5 is recorded.
  - Covered: all ten bands finite and not all zero (RasterMerger's fill). A point on an uncovered pixel is in the grid
    but not graded.
  - Prediction: the argmax over all ten channels, as rslearn takes it; a point predicted as the untrained channel 9
    counts as an error and is counted (exp89).
  - Confidence: the top-1 softmax probability over the trained channels 0 to 8 (exp89's graded form). A softmax kept
    to a subset of its channels is the full softmax renormalised over the subset, so it is computed from the written
    probabilities exactly. The ranking reads signals.confidence(form="top1") on their logarithms, minus the log of that
    probability, which keeps the order where the probability itself rounds to 1.0 (float32 keeps the small
    probabilities down to about 1e-45). Points where every other trained probability is 0 in float32 tie; counted.
  - Clusters: the annotation task, the window name before "_point_" (exp21's and exp89's 30 validation tasks).

Outputs (exp/out, --out-dir moves them): exp98_summary.json (the run), exp98_units.npz (per point: name, split,
label, the deployed class and confidence, the condition code, the burn code (-2 without the layer), the boundary
cue; no position), exp98_inventory.json (--inventory), exp98_summary_smoke.json (--smoke). Nothing written holds a
coordinate, a transform or a bound.

# A 120 x 160 px map at 10 m, rows 0-19 uncovered. Forty validation points are covered (one of them reprojected from
# another CRS), two lie outside the grid and two on uncovered pixels; ten training points are covered; two windows are
# dropped by the label rule. The forty graded points are ranked by design: errors at the seven least confident and at
# the most confident one, so the AUROC is 7 * 32 / (8 * 32) = 0.875 and the 5%, 10% and 20% captures are 2/8, 4/8 and
# 7/8. One error is predicted as the untrained channel 9 with the label second. The replica agrees on 36 of 40 points:
# it is right where the deployed map is wrong at ranks 0 to 2 and wrong where it is right at rank 20.
# The map is read in two parts, as the real one is (two from-olmoearth directories, two deployment dataset roots):
# part 0 holds columns 0-99, part 1 columns 80-159. Columns 80-89 are covered in both, with equal values, and count
# once; columns 90-99 are NaN in part 0 and covered in part 1, so a point there must be read from part 1. Eleven
# labelled windows sit in both parts (eight graded validation points, two training points, one on the uncovered rows):
# five are covered in both, five only in part 1.
