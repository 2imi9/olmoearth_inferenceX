"""exp98, the burned-area stage: a condition layer that says where MODIS mapped a burn in 2023, on the grid of each
part of the re-run map (exp/jobs/e98_burned.sh runs it after exp/jobs/e98_read.sh).

Why. East African savanna burns every year, and a fresh burn scar may be mapped confidently wrong. The AWF legend has
one class for grassland and barren, so burnt grass read as bare is no error; burnt shrubland or savanna read as
grassland/barren, or a dark scar read as a dark class (open water, herbaceous wetland, lava forest), would be. With
this layer `oe-inferencex assess --condition` ranks burned and unburned windows apart, and exp98's Part H
(report-only, docs/plan/awf_deployment.md) describes the map's confidence and Ai2's validation points by it.

Source, as verified on 2026-10-08 from the STAC API's metadata and the product's documents (no pixel was read off
the cluster):
  - Microsoft Planetary Computer's STAC API (https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1), collection
    `modis-64A1-061`, "MODIS Burned Area Monthly", MCD64A1 Collection 6.1. One item per MODIS sinusoidal tile
    (2400 x 2400 cells of 463.3 m) and calendar month: start_datetime is the month's first day, end_datetime its last.
    Assets: `Burn_Date` (int16 COG), `QA` (uint8 COG), `Burn_Date_Uncertainty`, `First_Day`, `Last_Day`, `hdf`,
    `metadata`. The hrefs are on Azure blob storage and are signed with planetary_computer.sign_inplace, as
    oe_inferencex/data.py signs its Sentinel-2 and WorldCover reads. This file does not import data.py, which needs
    the encoder extra.
  - Burn_Date (MCD64 Collection 6.1 User Guide, section 3.1.2): the ordinal day of the year on which the cell burned,
    1 to 366; 0 unburned land; -1 unmapped for lack of valid data; -2 water. The file name's day of year is the first
    day of the calendar month the file maps (Table 2); a burn date outside that month is counted, not expected.
  - QA, an 8-bit field (same section): bit 0 land (1) or water (0); bit 1 valid data (1: enough valid data in the
    time series to process the cell; always 0 for water); bit 2 shortened mapping period (burns could not be mapped
    over the whole month); bit 3 relabelled in the contextual phase; bit 4 spare; bits 5-7 a special-condition code for
    a cell classified unburned (0 none, 1 observations too sparse in time, 2 too few training observations or poor
    separability, 3 apparent burn date at the limits of the time series, 4 apparent water contamination, 5 persistent
    hot spot). This stage checks Burn_Date's special values against bits 0 and 1 on every cell it reads and refuses
    a disagreement on more than QA_TOLERANCE of them, so the encoding above is tested on the real files.
  - Accuracy (guide section 7): against Landsat 8 pairs, global omission 72.6% and commission 40.2%, the omission
    mostly small burns; cropland burns are low confidence (section 8.1).
  - Licence: the STAC record says "proprietary" and links LP DAAC's data citation and policies page, which now
    redirects to NASA Earthdata's data use guidance: data from a NASA-led mission are Creative Commons Zero (CC0)
    unless marked otherwise, a citation is requested, and NASA material may not suggest NASA's endorsement. Cite

  - September 2023 is not on Planetary Computer. On 2026-10-08 the collection held 268 items for August 2023 and 268
    for October 2023, and none for September 2023 anywhere on Earth, while NASA's CMR listed 268 September 2023
    granules, the tile over this area among them. A missing month is refused unless --allow-missing names it; the job
    names 2023-09. A cell that burned in a month not read reads as not burned, so code 0's name says which months
    were not read, and every record lists them. --item supplies a month from local GeoTIFFs of Burn_Date and QA (for
    instance converted from LP DAAC's granule, which needs an Earthdata login).

The codes, per 500 m MODIS cell over the months read, then per 10 m pixel by nearest neighbour:
     1  burned: a burn date (1 to 366) in any month read
     0  not burned: unburned land (0) in every month read
    -1  unrecorded: no burn date and, in at least one month read, water (-2), unmapped (-1), or no tile over the cell
A code 2, "burned before a Sentinel-2 timestep the model read", is not written. The model reads 12 mosaics of 30-day
periods, each built per pixel from several scenes ordered by cloud cover, so the date of the scene at a pixel is not
in the item groups' time ranges, and items.json (the scenes' footprints) stays on scratch; and every burn before the
last period is followed by later periods, so the code would hold nearly every burned pixel and separate nothing.

Resolution. A MODIS cell is about 463 m on a side: about 2,150 pixels of 10 m and about 134 windows of 40 m (assess's
default 4-pixel window). The layer says whether the 500 m cell around a pixel burned, not whether the pixel did:
along a burn scar's edge, unburned pixels read 1 and burned ones 0. Nearest neighbour gives each 10 m pixel the code
of the MODIS cell that holds its centre; the warp transforms every pixel exactly (tolerance 0). rasterio's default
tolerance allows 0.125 input pixels, up to 58 m here, and on a synthetic 5 km grid it gave 0.1% of the pixels a
neighbouring cell's code (tests/test_exp98_burned.py checks every pixel against its own transform).

Outputs, for each part directory (one from-olmoearth output, exp/jobs/e98_read.sh):
    burned_<EPSG>.tif          int32 on the grid of scores_<EPSG>.tif, the codes above, -1 also the raster's no-data
    burned_conditions.json     the codes' names, the exact --condition-names string, the rule, the source, the months
and, over all parts, a counts-only record (--out-json): per part and grid the covered pixels (the scores' ten bands
finite and not all zero, exp98's rule), the share of them per code, why the unrecorded ones are unrecorded, the share
burned in each month read, and the QA checks. No coordinate, bound, transform, tile or item id is written or printed.
