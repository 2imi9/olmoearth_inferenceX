"""exp31: feature-space typicality as a label-free error signal.

exp13's E_dist (mean cosine distance from a patch's pooled Base feature to
its five nearest patches of the head's training scene) found 13/27 against
confidence, sign p = 1.00, and on hand labels was the worst signal tested
(22/329, exp18). It conflates two choices: the reference set (the head's 1024
training patches at Katima, a proxy for neither the pretraining distribution
nor the evaluated scene) and the density estimator (a raw k-NN distance).
Roadmap item 9 asks for a formalisation (AOA / dissimilarity index). This
experiment separates the two: does the pooled 768-d Base feature of a 4-px
patch being atypical, relative to a stated reference set, rank the probe's
errors? Three reference sets, three density scores each, plus two
labelled-reference variants. No evaluation label is ever an input.

Reference sets. R1 "training patches of the head": part A the katima
training scene's 1024 pooled patches; part B the valid patches of the 600
valid-split training tiles (~135k) with their training labels. R2 "same
scene": the evaluated unit's own patches (a 32x32 scene in A, a 15x15 tile in
B), cross-fitted over 5 random folds (numpy seed 0 per unit): the reference
is fitted on 4/5 of the unit's patches and scores the held-out fifth, so no
patch is scored against itself; the same code path serves all three
densities. That reference is small (819 / 180 patches, fewer than the 768
feature dimensions in B), so the Gaussian scores need shrinkage and the PCA
dimension is capped. R3 "cross-testbed pool", a proxy for a
pretraining-distribution reference: part A all Sen1Floods11 tiles cached by
exp18 (exp/out/exp18_feats.npz keys tr_base, bolivia_base0, test_base0;
~394k patches from 11 countries); part B the 27 rule scenes' shift-0
features plus katima from exp/out/exp11_feats.npz (~28.7k patches). The real
thing would be a sample of olmoearth_pretrain_dataset; that is the upgrade
path. When a cache is missing (always in --smoke) R3 falls back, with a
WARNING, to the other scenes' shift-0 pooled features plus the training
scene (part A, per scene, excluding the scene itself) or to the part-A
features (part B; the training scene alone if part A was skipped); the
summary records what R3 was and its size.

Scores per reference set R, all higher = more atypical. (1) kNN: mean cosine
distance to the k = 5 nearest reference patches (L2-normalised features,
distance 1 - cosine); for R1 in part A this is exp13's E_dist exactly, and a
real run compares its per-scene E-AURC with exp/out/exp13_corrected_stats.csv.
(2) Mahalanobis: (x - mu)^T S_a^-1 (x - mu) with mu and S from the reference
and S_a = (1 - a) S + a tr(S)/D I, a the closed-form Ledoit-Wolf (2004)
coefficient (own implementation; no sklearn). (3) PCA residual (the residual
term of ViM, Wang et al. 2022): norm of the component of x - mu orthogonal to
the top-d principal directions of the reference, d = min(192, n_ref // 2).
One eigendecomposition of S serves (2) and (3), since S_a shares S's
eigenvectors. Labelled-reference variants on R1 only, where the head's own
training labels are legitimately available: (4) class-conditional
Mahalanobis (Lee et al. 2018): per-class means, shared shrunk covariance,
min over the two classes. (5) ViM (Wang et al. 2022) adapted to the
one-logit binary head: origin o = -pinv(W) b = -b w / ||w||^2, principal
subspace fitted on X_train - o, residual r(x) = ||P_perp (x - o)||, alpha =
sum_train max(0, logit) / sum_train r, virtual logit alpha r, class logits
[0, logit] (a sigmoid is a two-way softmax), score = exp(alpha r) / (1 +
exp(logit) + exp(alpha r)) computed with logsumexp. ViM fuses confidence and
typicality by construction and is not a pure typicality score. One
diagnostic signal, ||x||_2 of the pooled feature, shows whether any density
is just feature norm. The encoder runs in fp32 (harness); the density fits
and scores are float64 on the same device.

Controls and references (exp/harness_ab.py): confidence (negative absolute
logit), aligned tile-phase, boundary indicator and the NDWI-gradient control;
constant score, S2 within-patch variance and NDWI level as observed-input
controls.

Preregistered, fixed before running. Primary score: "kNN-5 cosine [R2
scene]", the only member of the family that is label-free AND needs no
external data at inference. Combination U+ = "combination conf+typicality
(prereg)" = mean of the within-unit midrank percentiles of confidence and of
the primary score. Inference: per-river mean gain of U+ over confidence,
one-sided exact sign test over the 8 river clusters (7/8 -> p = 0.035).
Everything else is secondary and reported with the same tests.

Evaluation. (A) The 27 rule-selected exp11 scenes against the exp13
disagreement set (seed-0 Base head trained on katima, errors against
WorldCover 2021; scenes with fewer than 8 errors skipped). (B) Sen1Floods11
Bolivia hand labels exactly as exp18 (600 valid-split training tiles, 60x60
crops, same head, same patch-label pooling, per-tile rule of at least three
errors and three correct patches). Both parts compare every signal with
confidence, tile-phase, boundary and the NDWI-gradient control on identical
errors: W/L/T, exact sign tests, a sign-flip permutation test on mean
E-AURC differences (A), and per-unit Spearman of the new signals with the
references (is it new information?).

Inputs. exp/out/exp11_scenes.npz and exp/out/exp03_cache.npz (committed),
exp/out/exp11_feats.npz and exp/out/exp18_feats.npz (gitignored cluster
caches; the harness recomputes pooled features when the first is missing,
part B recomputes with exp18.embed when the second is missing), the Base
checkpoint from the HF cache, data/floods/flood_{valid,bolivia}_data.pt
(downloaded when missing outside --smoke), exp/out/exp13_corrected_stats.csv
for the R1 kNN self-check.

Outputs. exp/out/exp31_feature_typicality.csv (one row per scene x signal
for part A, pooled and per tile x signal for part B), exp31_summary.json
(tests, preregistered river test, diagnostics: shrinkage, PCA dimension,
reference sizes, mean kNN distances, R3 provenance, exp13 self-check,
failures), exp31_cache.npz (per-unit score arrays and errors), and
exp31_floods_feats.npz when part-B features are recomputed. --smoke runs on
CPU with 2 scenes at 64-px crops and --smoke-tiles flood tiles per split and
writes the same files with a _smoke suffix.

fp32 only: no autocast, no TF32, no compile.
