"""exp92: the package on published map products with an independent probability sample (preregistered 4 October 2026).

Question. Every labelled-route result so far was graded on the record's own probe maps. Here the maps are published
products and the reference is an independent probability sample: do the package's three labelled routes and its
ranking hold there?

Reference. LCMAP Reference Data Product v1.2 (Pengra et al. 2020; USGS ScienceBase 5e42e54be4b0edb47be84535,
LCMAP_CU_20211117_V01_REF.zip, sha256 eb935d96...b4c, public domain): 25,000 plots, a simple random sample of the 30 m
pixels of the conterminous United States, each interpreted for every year 1984-2018 into LCMAP's eight primary
classes (column `LCMAP`). Year 2018. The plots' coordinates are pixel centres of LCMAP's Albers grid.

Maps (2018), read at the plots from Microsoft Planetary Computer (no login):
  A. LCMAP CONUS Collection 1.3, primary land cover `lcpri` (30 m; classes 1-8 as the reference), and its confidence
     `lcpconf` (1-100 a confidence that the label matches the training data; 151-213 provenance codes, kept apart).
  B. Esri 10 m Annual Land Use Land Cover v2 (`io-lulc-annual-v02`), the majority of the 3 x 3 pixels of 10 m around
     the plot centre (ties to the centre pixel), crosswalked to LCMAP's classes: water 1 -> Water, trees 2 -> Tree
     Cover, flooded vegetation 4 -> Wetland, crops 5 -> Cropland, built area 7 -> Developed, bare ground 8 -> Barren,
     snow/ice 9 -> Snow/Ice, rangeland 11 -> Grass/Shrub; clouds 10 and no data 0 leave the plot out of comparisons.
Reading: `lcpri` and Esri at all 25,000 plots; `lcpconf` at a random 5,000 of them (seed 92), drawn before any value is
read. Only the values at the plots are kept, with plot ids and no coordinates.

Population for the simulations: V, the plots where the reference and both maps have a class (and A_V, where the
reference and A have one). The plots stand in for the map: their truth is known, so every rate below is graded exactly.

Q1, which map is more accurate (exp90's design on a product pair). On V the full-truth difference is
Delta = acc_A - acc_B = (K_A - K_B)/N over the D plots where A and B differ. For n in 50, 100 and 200 labels, 2,000
draws each (seed 92), exp90's `cell`: n labels among the D differing plots ("disagree") or n from all of V analysed on
the differing plots they hold ("random"); coverage of Delta, how often the interval names the right map, the wrong
map, and its median width.
Q2, how wrong each map is. For A and B on V, 2,000 simple random samples of 300 plots (seed 92): coverage of the exact
hypergeometric interval for the map's error rate on V, and its median width.
Q3, does the product's own confidence rank its errors. On the `lcpconf` subset, plots with lcpconf 1-100 and a
reference and an A class: the AUROC of (101 - lcpconf) for A's errors with a 95% bootstrap interval (2,000 resamples,
seed 92), the share of A's errors in the 10% least confident plots (tie-aware) against 10% for a random order and the
attainable ceiling, and the excess AURC. Descriptive beside it: the provenance codes' shares and error rates, and the
same ranking statistics for A-B disagreement (1 where the maps differ) as a label-free comparator.

Predictions.
  P1. The disagree design's interval covers Delta on at least 94% of draws at every budget.
  P2. At 100 labels its median width is less than half the random design's.
  P3. The exact interval covers each map's error rate on V on at least 94% of draws.
  P4. LCMAP's confidence ranks its errors: AUROC at least 0.65 with the bootstrap interval's lower end above 0.5, and
      the 10% least confident plots hold at least 20% of the errors (twice a random order).
No prediction about which map is more accurate.

What this cannot show. The reference uses LCMAP's legend and was collected by LCMAP's programme, so B is graded in a
foreign legend through a crosswalk (rangeland against grass/shrub, flooded vegetation against wetland) and at a finer
resolution: Delta measures agreement with this reference, not which map is better in general. Whether any reference
plot was used to train LCMAP Collection 1.3 is not checked here. One year, one country. The plots as a finite
population make Q1 and Q2 exact gradings of the designs on real maps, not new evidence about CONUS beyond the sample.

Amendment, 5 October 2026, before any value was analysed. The first full read stalled on an HTTP request with no
timeout and was stopped at an hour with nothing written. A smoke run then showed that the year's date filter also
returned Esri's 2017 items (their ranges end on 1 January 2018), so some plots could take 2017's class. Items are now
kept only where their range starts in 2018 (both collections), requests time out after 30 s, and each finished tile is
appended to a resumable checkpoint. The design, samples and predictions are unchanged.

Usage.
    uv run --no-sync python exp/exp92_lcmap_products.py extract     # reads the maps at the plots; about ten minutes
    uv run --no-sync python exp/exp92_lcmap_products.py analyze     # writes exp/out/exp92_summary.json
